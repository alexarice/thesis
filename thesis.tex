\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}

We begin with an overview of the important concepts required for the rest of the thesis. Throughout, we will assume knowledge of various basic concepts from computer science, as well as a basic knowledge of category theory (including functor categories, presheafs, and (co)limits) and type theory. The following sections introduce a form of globular higher categories and give a definition of the type theory \Catt, close to the original definition.

This section additionally serves as a place to introduce the various syntax and notation which will be used throughout the rest of the thesis.

\section{Higher categories}
\label{sec:higher-categories}

\todo[inline]{Add references throughout}
A higher category is a generalisation of the ordinary notion of a category to allow higher dimensional structure. This manifests in the form of allowing arrows or morphisms to have their source or target be another morphism instead of an object. More precisely, higher categories are equipped with the notion of an \(n\)-cell, where an \((n+1)\)-cell has source and target \(n\)-cells, and \(0\)-cells play the role of objects in an ordinary category.

The role of objects is played by \(0\)-cells, with \(1\)-cells as the morphisms between these objects. For \(0\)-cells \(x\) and \(y\), a \(1\)-cell \(f\) with source \(x\) and target \(y\) will be drawn as:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y
    \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
or may be written as \(f: x \to y\).\todo{should arrowheads be smaller?} Two cells are \emph{parallel} if they have the same source and target. Between any two parallel \(n\)-cells \(f\) and \(g\), we have a set of \((n+1)\)-cells between them. A \(2\)-cell \(\alpha : f \to g\) may be drawn as:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f", curve={height=-12pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g"', curve={height=12pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=0]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
and a \(3\)-cell \(\gamma\) between parallel \(2\)-cells \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) could be could be drawn as:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x && y
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f", curve={height=-15pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g"', curve={height=15pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\alpha", shift left=4, shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=0]
    \arrow[""{name=3, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\beta"', shift right=4, shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=0]
    \arrow["\gamma", shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt, Rightarrow, nfold=3, from=2, to=3]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

Just as in ordinary \(1\)-category theory, we expect to be able to compose morphisms. For \(1\)-cells, nothing has changed, given \(1\)-cells \(f: x \to y\) and \(g : y \to z\) we form the composition \(f * g\):
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y & z
    \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2, "f"]
    \arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3, "g"]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
which has source \(x\) and target \(z\). We pause here to note that composition will be given in ``diagrammatic order'' throughout the whole thesis, which is the opposite of the order of function composition but the same as the order of the arrows if drawn head to tail. This is chosen as it will be common for us to draw higher dimensional arrows in a diagram, and rare for us to consider categories where the higher arrows are given by functions. In an attempt to avoid confusion, we use an asterisk (\(*\)) to represent composition of arrows or cells in a higher category, and will use a circle (\(\circ\)) only for function composition.

In two dimensions, there is no longer a singular composition operation. For \(2\)-cells \(\alpha : f \to g\) and \(\beta : g \to h\), the composite \(\alpha *_1 \beta\) can be formed as before:

    \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g"{description}, from=1-1, to=1-3]

    \arrow["\beta", shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=2, to=1]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

We refer to this composition as \emph{vertical composition}. We can also compose cells \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in the following way:

\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y & z
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "i", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=3, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "h"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=0]
    \arrow["\beta", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=3, to=2]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

This composition is called the \emph{horizontal composition}, and is written \(\alpha *_0 \beta\). The subscript refers to the dimension of the shared boundary in the composition, with the \(1\)-cell \(g\) being the shared boundary in the vertical composition example and the \(0\)-cell \(y\) being the shared boundary in the horizontal composition example. The dimension of this shared boundary is the \emph{codimension} of the composition.

This pattern continues with \(3\)-cells, which can be composed at codimension \(0\), \(1\), or \(2\), as below:

For every \(n\)-cell \(x\), there is an \((n+1)\)-cell \(\id(x) : x \to x\), called the \emph{identity morphism}.

As with 1-categories, \(\infty\)-categories need to satisfy certain equalities, which fall into 3 groups: associativity, unitality, and interchange. The associativity laws are the same as for 1-categories, only now a law is needed for each composition (every dimension and codimension).

Unitality is again similar to the case for 1-categories, except we again need unitality laws for each composition. We note that for lower codimension compositions, an iterated identity is needed. For example given a \(2\)-cell \(\alpha : f \to g\), the appropriate equation for left unitality of horizontal composition is:
\[ \id(\id(x)) *_0 \alpha = \alpha \]
In general for a unit to be cancelled, it must be iterated a number of times equal to the difference between the dimension and codimension of the composition.

Interchange laws do not appear in 1-categories, and specify how compositions of different dimensions interact. The first interchange law states that for suitable \(2\)-cells \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\), and \(\delta\), that:
\[ (\alpha *_0 \gamma) *_1 (\beta *_0 \delta) = (\alpha *_1 \beta) *_0 ()\]

There are also interchange laws for the interaction of composition and identities; A composition of two identities is the same as an identity on the composition of the underlying cells.


The \(\infty\)-categories that we study in this thesis will be globular, meaning that their cells form a globular set. A globular set can be seen as natural extension of the data of a category, whose data can be arranged into the following diagram:\todo{Need a remark somewhere about other shapes of higher category}

where \(O\) is a set of objects, \(M\) is a set of all morphisms, and \(s\) and \(t\) are functions assigning each morphism to its source and target object respectively. \(2\)-cells can be added to this diagram in a natural way:

    \arrow["{t_1}"', shift right, from=1-1, to=1-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
In a globular set, the source and target of any cell must be parallel, meaning they share the same source and target. This condition is imposed by \emph{globularity conditions}. Adding these and iterating the process leads to the following definition.

\begin{definition}
  The category of globes \(\mathbf{G}\) has objects given by the natural numbers and morphisms generated from \(\mathbf{s}_n, \mathbf{t}_n : n \to n + 1\) quotiented by the \emph{globularity conditions}:
  \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{s}_{n+1} \circ \mathbf{s}_n &= \mathbf{t}_{n+1} \circ \mathbf{s}_n\\
    \mathbf{s}_{n+1} \circ \mathbf{t}_n &= \mathbf{t}_{n+1} \circ \mathbf{t}_n\\
  \end{align*}

   The category of globular sets \(\mathbf{Glob}\), is the presheaf category \([\mathbf{G}, \mathbf{Set}]\).
 \end{definition}

Unwrapping this definition, a globular set \(G\) consists of sets \(G(n)\) for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), with source and target maps \(s_n, t_n : G(n+1) \to G(n)\), forming the following diagram:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \cdots & {G(3)} & {G(2)} & {G(1)} & {G(0)}
    \arrow["{s_0}", shift left, from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \arrow["{t_0}"', shift right, from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \arrow["{s_1}", shift left, from=1-3, to=1-4]
    \arrow["{t_1}"', shift right, from=1-3, to=1-4]
    \arrow["{t_2}"', shift right, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow["{s_2}", shift left, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow[shift right, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[shift left, from=1-1, to=1-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
and satisfying the globularity conditions. A morphism of globular sets \(F : G \to H\) is a collection of functions \(G(n) \to H(n)\) which commute with source and target maps.

Given a globular set \(G\), we will call the elements of \(G(n)\) the \(n\)-cells and write \(f : x \to y\) for an \((n+1)\)-cell \(f\) where \(s_n(f) = x\) and \(t_n(f) = y\). We further define the \(n\)-boundary operators \(\delta_n^-\) and \(\delta_n^+\) which take the source or target respectively of a \((n+k)\)-cell \(k\) times, returning an \(n\)-cell.

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:disc}
  The \(n\)-disc \(D^n\) is a finite globular set given by \(Y(n)\), where \(Y\) is the Yoneda functor \(\mathbf{G} \to \mathbf{Glob}\). \(D^n\), has no \(k\)-cells for \(k > n\), a single \(n\)-cell \(d_n\), and two \(m\)-cells \(d_m^-\) and \(d_m^+\) for \(m < n\). Every \((m+1)\)-cell of \(D^n\) has source \(d_m^-\) and target \(d_m^+\). The first few discs are depicted in \cref{fig:discs}. The Yoneda lemma tells us that a map of globular sets \(D^n \to G\) is the same as an \(n\)-cell of \(G\). For an \(n\)-cell \(x\) of \(G\), we let \(\{x\}\) be the unique map \(D^n \to G\) which sends \(d_n\) to \(x\).

We can now give the definition of a (strict) \(\infty\)-category.

\begin{definition}
  A (strict) \(\infty\)-category is a globular set \(G\) with operations:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For \(m < n\), a composition \(*_m\) taking \(n\)-cells \(f\) and \(g\) with \(\delta_m^+(f) = \delta_m^-(g)\) and giving an \(n\)-cell \(f *_m g\) with:
    \begin{align*}
      s(f *_m g) &= \begin{cases*}
        s(f)&\text{if \(m = n - 1\)}\\
        s(f) *_m s(g)&\text{otherwise}
      \end{cases*}\\
      t(f *_m g) &= \begin{cases*}
        t(g)&\text{if \(m = n - 1\)}\\
        t(f) *_m t(g)&\text{otherwise}
      \end{cases*}
    \end{align*}
  \item For \(n\)-cell \(x\), an identity \((n+1)\)-cell \(\id(x) : x \to x\).
  \end{itemize}
  and satisfying equalities:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Associativity: Given \(m < n\) and \(n\)-cells \(f\), \(g\), and \(h\) with \(\delta_m^+(f) = \delta_m^-(g)\) and \(\delta_m^+(g) = \delta_m^-(h)\):
    \[ (f *_m g) *_m h = f *_m (g *_m h) \]
  \item Unitality: Given \(m < n\) and \(n\)-cell \(f\):
    \begin{align*}
      \id^{n-m}(\delta_m^-(f)) *_m f &= f\\
      f *_m \id^{n-m}(\delta_m^+(f)) &= f
    \end{align*}
  \item Composition interchange: If \(o < m < n\) and \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\), and \(\delta\) be \(n\)-cells with
    \[\delta_m^+(\alpha) = \delta_m^-(\beta)\qquad
      \delta_m^+(\gamma) = \delta_m^-(\delta)\qquad
      \delta_o^+(\alpha) = \delta_o^-(\gamma)\]
    then:
    \[(\alpha *_o \gamma) *_m (\beta *_o \delta) = (\alpha *_m \beta) *_o (\gamma *_m \delta)\]
  \item Identity interchange: Let \(m < n\) and \(f\) and \(g\) be \(n\)-cells with \(\delta_m^+(f) = \delta_m^-(g)\). Then:
    \[\id(f) *_m \id(g) = \id(f *_m g)\]
  \end{itemize}
  A morphism of \(\infty\) categories is a morphism of the underlying globular sets which preserves composition and identities.
\end{definition}

There is a clear forgetful functor from the category of strict infinity categories to the category of globular sets, which has a left adjoint given by taking the free strict infinity category over a globular set.

We end this section with an example of a non-trivial application of the axioms of an infinity category, known as the Eckmann-Hilton argument. The argument show's that any two scalars (morphisms from the identity to the identity) commute.

\begin{proposition}[Eckmann-Hilton]
  \label{prop:eh}
  Let \(x\) be an \(n\)-cell in an \(\infty\)-category and let \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) be \((n+2)\)-cells with source and target \(\id(x)\). Then \(\alpha *_{n+1} \beta = \beta *_{n+1} \alpha\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The cells \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) can be manoeuvred around each other as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    &\phantom{{}={}} \alpha *_{n+1} \beta \\
    &= (\alpha *_n i) *_{n+1} (i *_n \beta)&\text{Unitality}\\
    &= (\alpha *_{n+1} i) *_n (i *_{n+1} \beta)&\text{Interchange}\\
    &= \alpha *_n \beta &\text{Unitality}\\
    &= (i *_{n+1} \alpha) *_n (\beta *_{n+1} i)&\text{Unitality}\\
    &= (i *_n \beta) *_{n+1} (\alpha *_n i)&\text{Interchange}\\
    &= \beta *_{n+1} \alpha&\text{Unitality}
  \end{align*}
  Where \(i = \id(\id(x))\).
\end{proof}

We give a more graphical representation of the proof in \cref{fig:eh}. In this proof the \(\alpha\) is moved to the left of \(\beta\), though we equally could have moved it round the right, and the choice made was arbitrary.

\subsection{Pasting diagrams}
\label{sec:pasting-diagrams}

\todo{Reference batanin and leinster here}

The definition of \(\infty\)-categories given in the previous section is close in spirit to the the ordinary definitions of 1-categories and clearly demonstrates the different families of axioms present. However, we will see in \cref{sec:weak}, that these sort of definitions do not scale well to our eventual setting of weak higher categories.

There is a special class of (finite) globular sets known as \emph{pasting diagrams} (sometimes known as pasting schemes). The elements of the free strict \(\infty\)-category on a globular set \(G\) can instead be represented by a pasting diagram and a map from this pasting diagram into \(G\). To do this, it must be possible to obtain a canonical composite from each pasting diagram.

Informally, we can define a \(n\)-dimensional pasting diagram to be a finite globular set which admits a unique full composite of dimension \(n\), where a full composite of a globular set \(G\) is an element of the free \(\infty\)-category over \(G\) which uses all the maximal elements. This functions as the primary intuition on the role of pasting diagrams.

Before giving a more formal definition of pasting diagrams, we explore some examples and non-examples. A more indepth discussion of pasting diagrams and representations of free strict \(\infty\)-categories using them can be found in \citeauthor{leinster2004higher}~\cite{leinster2004higher}. In contrast to \citeauthor{leinster2004higher}, we consider pasting diagrams as a full subcategory of globular sets, rather than a separate category with a function sending each pasting diagram to a globular set.

The disc contexts introduced in \cref{ex:disc} are all examples of pasting diagrams. The unique ``composite'' of these globular sets is just given by their maximal element, noting that we allow a singular cell in our informal definition of composite. The uniqueness of this is trivial as the only possible operations we could apply are compositions with units, which gives the same cell under the laws of an \(\infty\)-category.

The diagrams used to graphically represent our composition operations (of which we recall three below) are also pasting diagrams.

\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y & z
    \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["g", from=1-2, to=1-3]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x && y
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f"', curve={height=24pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "h", curve={height=-24pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g"{description}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=0, to=2]
    \arrow["\beta", shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=2, to=1]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \qquad
    \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y & z
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "i", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=3, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "h"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=0]
    \arrow["\beta", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=3, to=2]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

The composite of these diagrams is just the composite of the two maximal cells with the appropriate codimension.

We can also consider composites which are not binary composites of two cells of equal dimension. For example the following globular set is a pasting diagram:

\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y & z
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["h", from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=0]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
with a composite given by \(\alpha *_0 \id(h)\). This operation is fairly common (in fact we have already seen it in \cref{prop:eh}) and is known as \emph{whiskering}. In this case we would say that the composite is given by the right whiskering of \(\alpha\) with \(h\).

The 1-dimensional pasting diagrams are all given by chains of 1-cells of the form:
\[x_0 \overset{f_0}\to x_1 \overset{f_1}\to x_2 \overset{f_2}\to \cdots \overset{f_n}\to x_{n+1}\]
There are multiple ways to form a composite over these diagrams by repeated binary composition, however these all have the same result due to associativity.

Lastly we look at the diagram, where all the \(0\)-cells and \(1\)-cells are assumed to be distinct:

\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = large]
    \bullet & \bullet & \bullet
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, curve={height=-30pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, curve={height=30pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=3, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, curve={height=-30pt}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=4, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, curve={height=30pt}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=5, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=2]
    \arrow["\beta", shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt, Rightarrow, from=2, to=0]
    \arrow["\gamma", shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt, Rightarrow, from=4, to=5]
    \arrow["\delta", shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt, Rightarrow, from=5, to=3]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

We get a composite given by \((\alpha *_1 \beta) *_0 (\gamma *_1 \delta)\). The uniqueness of this composite is due to the interchange law.

Non-examples of pasting diagrams roughly fall into two groups: those that do not admit a composite, and those that admit many distinct composites. The following three globular sets fail to admit a composite (the last is drawn in a box to emphasise that \(z\) is part of the same globular set as \(x\), \(y\), \(f\), \(g\), and \(\alpha\)):

\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large, row sep = small]
    & y \\
    x \\
    & z
    \arrow["f", pos=0.6, from=2-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["g"', pos=0.6, from=2-1, to=3-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
    x & y
    \arrow["f", curve={height=-12pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["g"', curve={height=12pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \qquad
  \fbox{\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=scriptsize, ampersand replacement = \&]
    x \&\& y \& z
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=0]
  \end{tikzcd}}
\]
The globular set with a single \(0\)-cell \(x\), and a single \(1\)-cell \(f : x \to x\) has too many composites: \(f\) and \(f *_0 f\) need not be equal in an infinity category.

To describe the free \(\infty\)-category in terms of pasting diagrams we need to be able to extract a composite from a pasting diagram, and construct a pasting diagram from an arbitrary composite. Each pasting diagram having a unique composite solves the former issue.

To be able to construct a pasting diagram from a composite, we wish to equip our set of pasting diagrams itself with the structure of an \(\infty\)-category. We therefore need our pasting diagrams to have a notion of boundary and a notion of composition. A natural candidate for composition is given by colimits, as \(\mathbf{Glob}\) has all colimits due to being a presheaf category, and so it is sufficient for our class of pasting diagrams to be closed under these specific colimits. In fact, it is sufficient to contain a class of colimits known as \emph{globular sums}.

\begin{definition}
  A globular category is a category \(\mathcal{C}\), equipped with a disc functor \(D : \mathbf{G} \to \mathcal{C}\), specifying certain objects as discs in the category. A \emph{globular sum} is a colimit of a diagram of the form:
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = tiny, row sep = tiny]
      {D(i_0)} && {D(i_1)} && {D(i_2)} && {D(i_n)} && {D(i_{n+1})} \\
      &&&&& \cdots \\
      & {D(j_0)} && {D(j_1)} &&&& {D(j_n)}
      \arrow["{f_0}", from=3-2, to=1-1]
      \arrow["{g_0}"', from=3-2, to=1-3]
      \arrow["{f_n}", from=3-8, to=1-7]
      \arrow["{g_n}"', from=3-8, to=1-9]
      \arrow["{f_1}", from=3-4, to=1-3]
      \arrow["{g_1}"', from=3-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Where all morphisms \(f_i\) are a composite of source maps (\(D(\mathbf{s}_n)\) for some \(n\)) and the morphisms \(g_i\) are a composite of target maps (\(D(\mathbf{t}_n)\) for some \(n\)). Given that the maps \(f_i\) and \(g_i\) are uniquely determined, we may write such a globular sum as:

  \[ D(i_0) \amalg_{D(j_0)} D(i_1) \amalg_{D(j_1)} D(i_2) \cdots D(i_n) \amalg_{D(j_n)} D(i_{n+ 1})\]

  A \emph{globular extension} is a globular category where all globular sums exist, and a morphism of globular extensions is a functor of the underlying categories commuting with the disc functors and preserving globular sums.
\end{definition}

We can finally give our first definition of a pasting diagram.

\begin{definition}
  The category \(\mathbf{Glob}\) is a globular category with functor \(\mathbf{G} \to \mathbf{Glob}\) given by the Yoneda embedding. The category of \emph{pasting diagrams}, \(\mathbf{Pd}\), is the full subcategory containing the globular sets which are globular sums.
  The boundary of an \((n+1)\)-dimensional pasting diagram is given by replacing each instance of \(D^{n+1}\) by \(D^n\) in its globular sum representation. There are two canonical maps including the boundary into the original pasting diagram, whose images give the source and target of the pasting diagram.
\end{definition}

The category of pasting diagrams clearly forms a globular category, with the functor \(\mathbf{G} \to \mathbf{Pd}\) sending \(n\) to \(D^n\). It is a globular extension and is in fact the universal globular extension; it is initial in the category of globular extensions~\cite{Ara}.

We finish this section with one larger example.

\begin{example}
  The following depicts a \(2\)-dimensional pasting diagram.
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      x & y & z & w
      \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
      \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
      \arrow["h"', from=1-2, to=1-3]
      \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "k", curve={height=-24pt}, from=1-3, to=1-4]
      \arrow[""{name=3, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "i"', curve={height=24pt}, from=1-3, to=1-4]
      \arrow[""{name=4, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "j"{description}, from=1-3, to=1-4]

      \arrow["\gamma", shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=4, to=2]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]

  \]
  which are isomorphic pasting diagrams.
\end{example}

\subsection{Weak higher categories}
\label{sec:weak}

The \(\infty\)-categories we have defined so far have all been strict \(\infty\)-categories, meaning that the laws are required to hold up to equality. In ordinary \(1\)-category theory, isomorphism is usually preferred over equality for comparing objects. Similarly, when we have access to higher dimensional arrows, it follows that that we can also consider isomorphisms between morphisms, and therefore consider laws such as associativity up to isomorphism instead of equality.

Topological spaces provide one of the primary examples for where it is useful to consider weak laws. Given a topological space \(X\), we can define a globular set of paths and homotopies. Let the \(0\)-cells be given by points \(x\) of the topological space, let morphisms from \(x\) to \(y\) be given as paths \(I \to X\) (where \(I\) is the topological interval \([0,1]\)) which send \(0\) to \(x\) and \(1\) to \(y\), and let higher cells be given by homotopies. The natural composition of two paths \(p\) and \(q\) is the following path:
\[
  (p * q)(i) =
  \begin{cases*}
    p(2i)&when \(i < 0.5\)\\
    q(2i-1)&when \(i \geq 0.5\)
  \end{cases*}
\]
which effectively lines up the paths end to end. Given \(3\) paths \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\), the compositions \((p * q) * r\) and \(p * (q * r)\) are not identical but are equal up to homotopy, meaning the two compositions are isomorphic. Therefore in this case the composition \(p * q\) does not form a strict \(\infty\)-category structure, but rather a weak structure.

\paragraph{Weak 2-categories} We start our exploration of weak higher categories by considering the lower dimension case of bicategories (weak \(2\)-categories). Here, interchange must still be given by a strict equality, as there are no non-trivial \(3\)-cells in a \(2\)-category. However, associativity and unitality can be given by isomorphisms known as associators and unitors:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  &\alpha_{f,g,h} &&: (f *_0 g) *_0 h \to f *_0 (g *_0 h)\\
  &\lambda_f &&: \id(x) *_0 f \to f\\
  &\rho_f &&: f *_0 \id(y) \to f
\end{alignat*}
for \(f : x \to y\), \(g : y \to z\), and \(h : z \to w\).

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:spans}
  All strict 2-categories are also bicategories. The bicategory of spans is an example of a bicategory which is not strict. Starting with a category \(\mathcal{C}\) equipped with chosen pullbacks, we define the bicategory of spans over \(\mathcal{C}\) to be:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Objects are the same as \(\mathcal{C}\)
  \item Morphisms \(A\) to \(B\) are spans \(A \leftarrow C \to B\).
  \item A 2-morphism from \(A \leftarrow C \to B\) to \(A \leftarrow C' \to B\) is a morphism \(C \to C'\) such that the following diagram commutes:
    \[
      \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = small]
	& C \\
	A && B \\
	& {C'}
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=3-2]
	\arrow[from=3-2, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow[from=3-2, to=2-3]
      \end{tikzcd}
    \]
  \item Compositions and identities of 2-morphisms is given by composition and identities of the underlying morphisms in \(\mathcal{C}\).
  \item The identity on an object \(A\) is the span \(A \leftarrow A \to A\).
  \item Given spans \(A \leftarrow D \to B\) and \(B \leftarrow E \to C\), their composite is given by the pullback:
    \[
      \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=small]
	&& {D \times_B E} \\
	& D && E \\
	A && B && C
	\arrow[from=2-2, to=3-1]
	\arrow[from=2-2, to=3-3]
	\arrow[from=2-4, to=3-3]
	\arrow[from=2-4, to=3-5]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=2-4]
	\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=-45}, draw=none, from=1-3, to=3-3]
      \end{tikzcd}
    \]
  \item Associators and unitors are given by the universal property of the pullback.
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

In general, there could be many possible isomorphisms between \((f * g) * h\) and \(f * (g * h)\), and we require that the chosen morphisms satisfy certain compatibility properties. The first is that each of the associator, left unitor, and right unitor should be a natural isomorphism. The second is a property known as \emph{coherence}, saying that any two parallel morphisms built purely from naturality moves, associators, and unitors must be equal.

For bicategories it is sufficient to give two coherence laws: the triangle equality and pentagon equality. The triangle equality identifies two ways of cancelling the identity in the composite \(f * \id * g\), giving a compatibility between the left and right unitors. It is given by the following commutative diagram:

% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMyxbMCwwLCIoZiBcXHN0YXIgXFxpZCkgXFxzdGFyIGciXSxbMiwwLCJmIFxcc3RhciAoXFxpZCBcXHN0YXIgZykiXSxbMSwxLCJmIFxcc3RhciBnIl0sWzAsMSwiXFxhbHBoYV97ZixcXGlkLGd9Il0sWzAsMiwiXFxyaG9fZiBcXHN0YXJfMCBcXGlkKGcpIiwyXSxbMSwyLCJcXGlkKGYpXFxzdGFyXzBcXGxhbWJkYV9nIl1d

Surprisingly, these two equations are enough to give full coherence. For the example of spans from \cref{ex:spans}, these two equations follow from the uniqueness of the universal morphism.

\paragraph{Weak \(\infty\)-categories} To move from weak \(2\)-categories to weak \(3\)-categories, new coherence cells for interchangers are added to replace the interchanger equalities, and new equalities must be added to specify the interaction between the interchangers and other coherence morphisms. Furthermore, the triangle and pentagon equation from \(2\)-categories will become an isomorphisms in a weak \(3\)-category, causing more coherence equations to be added.

As we move up in dimension, the number of coherence morphisms and equalities required increases exponentially. Whereas a bicategory has 11 operations (1-identity, 2-identity, 1-composition, vertical composition, horizontal composition, left unitor (and inverse), right unitor (and inverse), and associator (and inverse)), where as a fully weak tricategory already has around 51 operations~\cite{gurski2006algebraic}\footnote{The number here is obtained by unwrapping various subdefinitions and should be treated as approximate.}. Comparisons between the size of partially weak definitions can be found in \cite{bar2017data}.

Because of this complexity, we look for more uniform ways to represent the operations and axioms of an \(\infty\)-category. In this thesis, we will work with the type theory \Catt, which is based on a definition of \(\infty\)-categories due to \citeauthor{maltsiniotis2010grothendieck}~\cite{maltsiniotis2010grothendieck}, which is itself based on a definition of \(\infty\)-groupoid by \citeauthor{PursuingStacks}~\cite{PursuingStacks}. We will sketch the ideas behind these definitions here, and give a definition of \Catt in \cref{sec:type-theory-catt}.

The key insight behind Grothendieck's definition is that pasting diagrams should be weakly contractible, instead of containing a unique composite. Whereas in a strict \(\infty\)-category, each pasting diagram effectively has 1 composite, in a weak \(\infty\)-category there can be many operations over a pasting diagram.

These operations are assembled into a globular extension called a \emph{coherator}. A weak \(\infty\)-groupoid is then a presheaf on this coherator for which the opposite functor preserves globular sums (alternatively, the dual notion of globular product could be defined, and such a presheaf could be asked to preserve globular products). The objects of a coherator are given by pasting diagrams, with \(D^n\) being sent to the \(n\)-cells of the category and other pasting diagrams being sent to composable sets of cells (as determined by the preservation of globular sums).

Operations over a pasting diagram \(P\) in the coherator are given by morphisms \(D^n \to P\). When we take a presheaf over this, we obtain a function that takes an \(P\)-shaped collection of cells to a single \(n\)-cell. Operations can be precomposed with source and target maps \(D^{n-1} \to D^n\) to get the source and target of an operation. To build the coherator, we start by taking the category of pasting diagrams. The ``operations'' of this category consist solely of the inclusions of discs into pasting diagrams, and correspond to picking a single element from the pasting diagram. Other operations are then built using the following guiding principle.

\begin{principle-groupoid}
  Let \(f\) and \(g\) be two parallel operations over a pasting diagram \(P\). Then there is an operation \(h\) over \(P\) with source \(f\) and target \(g\).
\end{principle-groupoid}

We define a pair of operations \(f,g : D^n \to X\) to be \emph{parallel} if \(n = 0\) or \(n > 0\) and \(f \circ \mathbf{s}_{n-1} = g \circ \mathbf{s}_{n-1}\) and \(f \circ \mathbf{t}_{n-1} = g \circ \mathbf{t}_{n-1}\). A \emph{lift} for such a pair of parallel operations is an operation \(h : D^{n+1} \to X\) such that \(h \circ \mathbf{s}_{n} = f\) and \(h \circ \mathbf{t}_n = g\). Closing under the principle then amounts to inductively adding lifts for all parallel operations, while ensuring that the category remains a globular extension.

We start with some basic operations: Consider the pasting diagram \(A\):

\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y & z
    \arrow["a", from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["b", from=1-2, to=1-3]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

where \(A = D^1 \amalg D^1\). Our rule now tells us that since \(x\) and \(z\) are elements of \(A\), that there should be an operation returning a cell with source \(x\) and target \(z\), namely the composition of \(a\) and \(b\). In the language of coherators, there are operations \(f, g : D^0 \to A\), where \(f\) includes into the source of the first disc of \(A\), and \(g\) includes into the target of the second disc of \(A\). These are trivially parallel, and so there exists a lift \(h : D^1 \to A\), giving 1-composition. Similarly, if we take the pasting diagram with a single \(0\)-cell \(x\) and no other cells, then applying our rule with \(f,g\) both being the operation returning the element \(x\) produces an operation with source and target \(x\), the identity on \(x\).

We can generate more complicated operations with this principle, consider pasting diagram \(B\):
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y & z & w
    \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["g", from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow["h", from=1-3, to=1-4]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
We already know the coherator contains 1-composition, and using composition and the universal property of globular sums, we can generate operations realising the compound composites \((f * g) * h\) and \(f * (g * h)\). The principle then gives us an operation returning the \(2\)-cell \((f * g) * h \to f * (g * h)\), which is of course our associator. This one principle allows us to generate all the structure we need, as well as structure that is arguably unnecessary, such as ternary compositions that did not appear in the definition of bicategory.

Unfortunately, as we have already mentioned, Grothendieck's definition is for \(\infty\)-groupoids, where everything is invertible, instead of \(\infty\)-categories in full generality, as we want to study in this thesis. This can be seen by taking the pasting diagram \(C\):
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y
    \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
and applying the rule with \(f\) returning \(y\) and \(g\) returning \(x\), giving an operation that returns a \(1\)-cell \(f^{-1} : y \to x\), the inverse of \(f\). The rule as we have stated it is too powerful.

Maltsiniotis' definition provides a solution to this problem by giving a more refined version of the principle. Whereas Grothendieck's definition treats all operations as coherences, Maltsiniotis' definition splits operations into two classes: compositions and equivalences. Both classes are obtained by restricting the classes of parallel operations that admit lifts.

We begin by defining what it means for an operation to be algebraic:
\begin{definition}
  Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a globular extension for which the canonical functor \(P : \mathbf{Pd} \to \mathcal{C}\) is faithful and the identity on objects. Then an operation \(f : D^n \to X\) in \(\mathcal{C}\) is \emph{algebraic} if whenever \(f = P(g) \circ f'\), \(g = \id\).
\end{definition}
Intuitively, an operation is algebraic when it does not factor through any proper inclusion. Algebraicity is equivalent to requiring that an operation makes use of all the (locally maximal) elements of the pasting diagram.

Equivalences contain the various invertible laws of our \(\infty\)-categories such as associators, unitors, identities, and interchangers. For two operations \(f,g : D^n \to X\) to admit a lift under the rule for equivalences, they must both be algebraic. This gives the following rule:

\begin{principle-category}[Equivalences]
  Let \(f\) and \(g\) be two parallel operations over a pasting diagram \(P\). If both \(f\) and \(g\) use all locally maximal variables of \(f\), then there is an operation over \(P\) with source \(f\) and target \(g\).
\end{principle-category}

Clearly any operations generated by this principle are invertible, as the extra condition imposed is symmetric. For compositions we introduce the following asymmetric principle, recalling that pasting diagrams are equipped with source and target inclusions, and letting \(\partial^-(P)\) and \(\partial^+(P)\) be the images of these inclusions:

\begin{principle-category}[Composites]
  Let \(f\) and \(g\) are parallel operations over a (non-singleton) pasting diagram \(P\) such that \(f\) uses all locally maximal cells of \(\partial^-(P)\) and no cells outside of \(\partial^-(P)\) and \(g\) uses all locally maximal cells of \(\partial^+(P)\) and no cells outside of \(\partial^+(P)\). Then there is an operation over \(P\) with source \(f\) and target \(g\).
\end{principle-category}

The condition required to form a composite can be expressed by the operation \(f : D^n \to P\) factoring into an algebraic map composed with the source inclusion into \(P\), and similar for \(g\) with the target inclusion. It can be easily checked that the inverse operation given above does not satisfy the criteria for being an equivalence or composite.

As with Grothendieck's definition, a coherator can be made by closing the globular extension of pasting diagrams under these restricted principles, and then weak \(\infty\)-categories can be defined to be presheaves on this coherator such that the opposite functor preserves globular sums.

\begin{remark}
  We have claimed that a coherator can be formed by closing under adding lifts to parallel operations, though this is not precise and there are actually multiple ways of performing this closure that lead to different coherators. For example, one could add the lift for 1-composition twice, to get two distinct 1-composition operations, as long as one also added a lift between these now parallel operations. Grothendieck gives a general schema for producing coherators, and conjectures that any two coherators give rise to equivalent models of \(\infty\)-categories.
\end{remark}

We now turn our attention back to the proof of Eckmann-Hilton from \cref{fig:eh}. Given a \(0\)-cell \(x\) and two scalars \(\alpha, \beta : \id(x) \to \id(x)\), we expect the Eckmann-Hilton argument to give us an isomorphism in a weak higher category, rather than the equality obtained in the strict case. In fact we immediately see that equalities 2, 3, and 4 in the proof can be immediately replaced by isomorphisms (interchangers and unitors).

The first and last equalities however are more problematic, although at first we may believe that there should exist some horizontal unitor isomorphism, upon closer inspection the two compositions do not even have the same boundary and so are not parallel. The composition \(\alpha *_1 \beta\) has source and target \(\id(x)\), whereas the source of \(\alpha *_0 \id(\id(x))\) is \(\id(x) *_0 \id(x)\).

To recover the proof in a weak setting, the intermediate composites must be composed with unitors so that they all have source and target \(\id(x)\). To give equivalences for the first and last step, these unitors must be moved around with naturality moves, and at a critical point the isomorphism \(\lambda_{\id(x)} \simeq \rho_{\id(x)}\) is required. Multiple full proofs of Eckmann-Hilton will be given in \cref{sec:rehydration}. The proof of Eckmann-Hilton is vastly simpler in strict case, mainly due to the presence of the equation \(\id(x) *_0 \id(x) = \id(x)\).
%  It is natural to ask whether it is necessary to work with weak higher categories at all, given the extra complexity.

% For bicategories, it turns out that the answer is no. Every bicategory is biequivalent to a strict 2-category~\cite[Theorem 1.4]{gordon1995coherence}, meaning that to prove any equation holds in a bicategory, it suffices to prove that the same equation holds in a strict 2-category. This allows the more general notion of bicategory to be used without incurring extra proof burden.

% For more than 2-dimensions, this full strictification is no longer possible.\todo{This should all likely go in the introduction}

\subsection{Computads}
\label{sec:computads}

A free group is generated by a set, and a free category is generated by a directed graph, and so it is a natural question what the generating data for a free higher category is. We have already seen that a free higher category can be generated by a globular set, but free \(\infty\)-categories can also be generated by data that does not form a globular set.

Consider the minimum data needed to to state the Eckmann-Hilton principle~(\cref{prop:eh}). We require a single \(0\)-cell \(x\), and two \(2\)-cells \(\alpha, \beta : \id(x) \to \id(x)\). This data does not form a globular set as, for example, the source of the \(2\)-cell \(\alpha\) is not in the generating data, but is rather an operation applied to the data. We could try to remedy this by adding a new \(1\)-cell \(f\) to the data to represent \(\id(x)\), but then the connection between \(\id(x)\) and \(f\) would be lost and \(f\) and \(\id(x)\) would be distinct in any free \(\infty\)-category generated on this data.

The correct generating data for an \(\infty\)-category is a \emph{computad}. A version for 2-categories was introduced by \citeauthor{street1976limits}~\cite{street1976limits}, which allows a generating \(2\)-cell to have a composite or identity as its source or target. These were extended to strict \(\infty\)-categories by \citeauthor{burroni1993higher}~\cite{burroni1993higher} and weak \(\infty\)-categories by
\citeauthor{batanin1998computads}~\cite{batanin1998computads}, which allow the source and target of an \(n\)-cell to be any \((n-1)\)-cell of the free \(\infty\)-category generated by the lower dimensional data.

A modern approach to computads for weak \(\infty\)-categories is given by \citeauthor{dean2022computads}~\cite{dean2022computads}, which avoids much of the complexity of globular operads, relying only on (mutual) structural induction. This definition of a computad is much closer in style (and is inspired by) the type theory \Catt which we review in \cref{sec:type-theory-catt}.

\section{The type theory \Catt}
\label{sec:type-theory-catt}

In this section we give an overview of the dependent type theory \Catt~\cite{finster2017type}. \Catt serves as a definition of weak \(\infty\)-categories, by defining a weak \(\infty\)-category to be a model of the type theory (e.g. using categories with families~\cite{MR1474535}). In \cref{cha:gener-pres-catt}, we give a more general and comprehensive presentation of \Catt, allowing the addition of equality relations to the type theory, preempting \cref{cha:cattstrict}. In contrast this section presents the version of \Catt closer to the one found in the literature, and compares its various constructions to the ideas introduced in \cref{sec:weak}.

\subsection{Syntax of \Catt}
\label{sec:syntax-catt}

\Catt has 4 classes of syntax: contexts, terms, types, and substitutions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Contexts contain a list of variables with an associated type. We can consider contexts as finite computads, the generating data for a weak \(\infty\)-category (see \cref{sec:computads}). It is alternatively valid to consider contexts in \Catt as finitely generated \(\infty\)-categories. The set of contexts contains all globular sets (and hence all pasting diagrams).
\item Terms over a context \(\Gamma\) correspond to the operations from \cref{sec:weak}. Terms can either be a variable, which corresponds to the operations which pick a single cell out of a globular set, or those generated by the unique constructor \(\mathsf{coh}\), which correspond to the operations generated by lifting. A term over a context \(\Gamma\) can also be seen as a element of the free \(\infty\)-category generated from \(\Gamma\).
\item Types over a context \(\Gamma\) consist of a collection of terms over the same context, and contain the boundary information for a term. Types either take the form of the constructor \(*\), the type of \(0\)-cells (which have no boundary data), or an arrow type \(\arr s A t\), where \(s\) and \(t\) are terms giving the source and target of the boundary and the type \(A\) gives lower dimensional boundary information\footnote{This can be viewed as a directed version of the equality type \(s =_A t\) from Martin-L\"of type theory}.
\item Substitutions from a context \(\Gamma\) to a context \(\Delta\) are a mapping from variables of \(\Gamma\) to terms of \(\Delta\). These play the role of functors between the \(\infty\)-categories generated by \(\Gamma\) and \(\Delta\) and are also syntactically crucial for forming compound composites in the theory.

    \vspace{-5pt}
  \caption{Syntax constructions in \Catt.}
  \label{fig:syntax}
\end{figure}

The rules for constructing each piece of syntax are given in \cref{fig:syntax}. To simplify the notation, we may avoid writing substitutions in a fully nested fashion, writing \(\langle \sigma , s , t \rangle\) instead of \(\langle \langle \sigma, s \rangle, t \rangle\), or \(\langle s \rangle\) instead of \(\langle \langle \rangle, s \rangle\). We may also omit the subscript in the arrow type. As opposed to the original paper on \Catt, we fibre terms, types, and substitutions over contexts, allowing us to avoid any problems with substitution only extending to a partial operation on terms. We write \(\Ctx\) for the set of contexts, \(\Term_\Gamma\) for the set of terms in a context \(\Gamma\), \(\Type_\Gamma\) for the set of types in a context \(\Gamma\), and write \(\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma\) when \(\sigma\) is a substitution taking variables of \(\Delta\) to terms of \(\Gamma\). In the literature, substitutions are often written as going in the opposite direction. We emphasise here that the direction of our substitution morphisms agrees with the direction of the function from variables to terms, the direction of the induced functor between the \(\infty\)-categories freely generated from the domain and codomain contexts, and the direction of arrows in a Grothendieck coherator.

We write \(\equiv\) for \emph{syntactic equality}, up to renaming of variables and \(\alpha\)-equivalence. The various pieces of syntax will be considered as equal up to this relation, which can be achieved by using a de Brujin index representation of the syntax as we present in \cref{cha:gener-pres-catt} for the formalisation. However, we continue to use named variables in the prose of the thesis to aid readability, assuming that all variables in a context are always distinct. We contrast this with the equality symbol, \(=\), which will represent the equality derived from extra equality rules we have placed on \Catt in \cref{sec:catt-with-equality}, and will be referred to as \emph{definitional equality}.

The action of a substitution \(\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma\) can be extended from variables to all terms \(t \in \Term_\Delta\), types \(A \in \Type_\Delta\), and substitutions \(\tau : \Theta \to \Delta\) by mutual recursion:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  &x \sub \sigma &&= t&\qquad&\text{if }(x \mapsto t) \in \sigma\\
  &\Coh \Theta A \tau \sub \sigma &&= \Coh \Theta A {\tau \bullet \sigma}\\
  &\star \sub \sigma &&= \star\\
  &\arr s A t \sub \sigma &&= \arr {s \sub \sigma} {A \sub \sigma} {t \sub \sigma}\\
  &\langle \rangle \bullet \sigma &&= \langle \rangle\\
  &\langle \tau , t \rangle \bullet \sigma &&= \langle \tau \bullet \sigma , t \sub \sigma \rangle
\end{alignat*}

For every context \(\Gamma\), there is an identity substitution \(\id_\Gamma\), which sends every variable to itself, which along with composition of substitutions above gives a category of contexts and substitutions.

The coherence constructor \(\Coh \Delta A \sigma\) allows us to construct lifts between parallel operations over pasting diagrams. The context \(\Delta\) plays the role of the pasting diagram. The type \(A\) will always be of the form \(\arr s B t\), and the terms \(s\) and \(t\) play the role of the parallel operation (with the type \(\arr s B t\) being well typed ensuring that \(s\) and \(t\) are parallel). The substitution \(\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma\) holds the data of a set of arguments to the coherence, allowing compound composites/operations to be formed and taking the role of composition of morphisms in the coherator.

We next define the free variables of each piece of syntax. These will be used to encode the condition of an operation being algebraic from the theory of non-invertible coherators. Let \(\Var(\Gamma)\) denote the variables of \(\Gamma\). For a term \(t \in \Term_\Gamma\), a type \(A \in \Type_\Gamma\) and a substitution \(\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma\) we define their free variables \(\FV(t), \FV(A), \FV(\sigma) \subseteq \Var(\Gamma)\) by mutual recursion.
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  &\FV(x) &&= \{x\} &\qquad&\text{if \(x\) is a variable}\\
  &\FV(\Coh \Delta A \sigma) &&= \FV(\sigma)\\
  &\FV(\star) &&= \{\}\\
  &\FV(\arr s A t) &&= \FV(s) \cup \FV(A) \cup \FV(t)\\
  &\FV(\langle \rangle) &&= \{\}\\
  &\FV(\langle \sigma , t \rangle) &&= \FV(\sigma) \cup \FV(t)
\end{alignat*}

The free variables of a term is often the wrong notion to use for testing algebraicity. For example in the context \(D^1\), the term \(d_1\) has free variables \(\{d_1\}\), whereas the unary composite of \(d_1\), \(\Coh {D_1} {\arr {d_0^-} \star {d_0^+}} {\id_{D^1}}\), has free variables \(\{d_0^-,d_0^+,d_1\}\). To remedy this, the original paper considers \(\FV(t) \cup \FV(A)\), for a term \(t\) of type \(A\). In this thesis we instead define the support of each piece of syntax, a purely syntactic construction.

\begin{definition}
  Fix a context \(\Gamma\). The subset \(V \subseteq \Var(\Gamma)\) is \emph{downwards closed} if for all \((x : A) \in \Gamma\) we have:
  \[x \in V \implies \FV(A) \subseteq V\]
  The downwards closure of a set \(V\) in a context \(\Gamma\), \(\DC_\Gamma(V)\) can be defined by induction on the context:
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
    &\DC_\emptyset(\emptyset) &&= \emptyset\\
    &\DC_{\Gamma, x : A}(V) &&=
                               \begin{cases*}
                                 \DC_\Gamma(V)&if \(x \not\in V\)\\
                                 \{x\} \cup \DC_\Gamma(V \cup \FV(A))&if \(x \in V\)\\
                               \end{cases*}
  \end{alignat*}
  The support of a term, type, or substitution is then defined as the downwards closure of its free variables:
  \[ \Supp(t) = \DC_\Gamma(\FV(t))\qquad \Supp(A) = \DC_\Gamma(\FV(A))\qquad \Supp(\sigma) = \DC_\Gamma(\FV(\sigma)) \]
  for terms \(t \in \Term_\Gamma\), types \(A \in \Type_\Gamma\), and substitutions \(\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma\).
\end{definition}

We will see later\todo{Cross ref} that for well-typed terms \(t\) of typed \(A\) that the support of \(t\) is equal to \(\FV(t) \cup \FV(A)\) and that \(\Supp(A) = \FV(A)\) for well-formed types. Modifying \Catt to use support therefore does not change the theory.

We lastly define the \emph{dimension} of types, contexts, and terms. For types this is defined recursively:
\[ \dim(\star) = 0 \qquad \dim(\arr s A t) = 1 + \dim(A) \]
For contexts we define \(\dim(\Gamma)\) to be the maximum of the dimension of each type in \(\Gamma\). For coherences \(\Coh \Gamma A \sigma\), the dimension is given by \(\dim(A)\), and for variables the dimension is given by the dimension of the associatiated type in the context.

\subsection{Ps-contexts}
\label{sec:ps-contexts}

We need to be able to describe pasting diagrams within the theory \Catt. As contexts model globular sets it is natural to treat pasting diagrams as a subset of contexts and will build pasting diagrams by iteratively attaching discs to a context. This is done by introducing the judgements:

\[ \Delta \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} x : A \qquad \text{and}\qquad \Delta \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} \]

If the first judgement holds, then \(\Delta\) is a pasting diagram for which a disc can be attached to the variable \(x\), called a \emph{dangling variable}, which has type \(A\). The contexts \(\Delta\) for which the second judgement holds are fully formed pasting diagrams, which we call \emph{Ps-contexts} (short for pasting scheme contexts). The rules for these judgements are given in \cref{fig:ps-context}.

We note that these rules do not just specify which globular sets are pasting diagrams, but they also specify an ordering on the elements of the pasting diagram, ensuring that there is a unique Ps-context for each pasting diagram. For example, the following judgement holds:
\begin{equation}
  \label[judgement]{judg:ps}
  (x : \star), (y : \star), (f : \arr x \star y), (z: \star), (g : \arr y \star z) \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}}
\end{equation}
However, the context:
\[(y : \star), (z : \star), (g : \arr y \star z), (x : \star), (f : \arr x \star y)\]
represents the same globular set but is not a Ps-context.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule{ }{(x : \star) \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} x : \star}{(\textsc{pss})}
    \and
    \inferrule{\Gamma \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} x : A}{\Gamma, (y : A), (f : \arr x A y)}{(\textsc{pse})}
    \and
    \inferrule{\Gamma \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} x : \arr s A t}{\Gamma \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} t : A}{\textsc{psd}}
    \and

  \end{mathpar}
  \caption{Rules for Ps-contexts}
  \label{fig:ps-context}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
  \cref{judg:ps} is given by the following derivation:
  \[\begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{ }
    \infer1[(\textsc{pss})]{(x : \star) \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} x : \star}
    \infer1[(\textsc{pse})]{(x : \star), (y : \star), (f : \arr x \star y) \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} f : \arr x \star y}
    \infer1[(\textsc{psd})]{(x : \star), (y : \star), (f : \arr x \star y) \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} y : \star}
    \infer1[(\textsc{pse})]{(x : \star), (y : \star), (f : \arr x \star y), (z : \star), (g : \arr y \star z) \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} g : \arr x \star y}
    \infer1[(\textsc{psd})]{(x : \star), (y : \star), (f : \arr x \star y), (z : \star), (g : \arr y \star z) \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}} z : \star}
    \infer1[(\textsc{ps})]{(x : \star), (y : \star), (f : \arr x \star y), (z : \star), (g : \arr y \star z) \vdash_{\mathsf{ps}}}
  \end{prooftree}\]
The applications of (\textsc{pse}) allow new variables to be added to the context, by adding a fresh variable, and attaching a variable from the dangling variable to the new fresh variable. The rule (\textsc{psd}) encodes that if we can attach a variable to \(f : x \to y\), then we can also attach a variable to \(y\). Finally, the rule (\textsc{ps}) forces as many (\textsc{psd}) rules to be applied as possible before completing the derivation, ensuring that derivations of Ps-contexts are unique.
\end{example}

We now state the following theorem, which follows immediately from \cite[Theorem~53]{benjamin2021globular}.

\begin{theorem}
  The set of Ps-contexts is in bijection with the set of pasting diagrams.
\end{theorem}

In order to use Ps-contexts as our notion of pasting diagram, we need to be able to identify the source and target variables of each Ps-context. This will be done by specifying the dimension \(i\) source and target of each pasting context.

More precisely, for each Ps-context \(\Gamma\) and \(i \in \mathbb{N}\), we define a Ps-context we define subcontexts:
\[ \inc i - \Gamma : \bound i \Gamma \to \Gamma \qquad \text{and}\qquad \inc i + \Gamma : \bound i \Gamma \to \Gamma\]
Intuitively, the context \(\bound i \Gamma\) can be constructed by removing any variables of dimension greater than \(i\) from \(\Gamma\), and quotienting the dimension \(i\) variables by the (symmetric transitive closure of the) relation \(x \sim y\) if there exists an \(f : x \to y\). The inclusions then send this quotiented variable to the variable appearing first in the equivalence class for the source inclusion, and the variable appearing last in the class for the target inclusion.

These contexts and substitutions can be defined by recursion on the context \(\Gamma\):
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  &\bound i {(x : \star)} &&= {(x : \star)}\\
  &\bound i {\Gamma, (y : A), (f : \arr x A y)} &&=
                                                  \begin{cases*}
                                                    \bound i \Gamma&if \(i \leq \dim(A)\)\\
                                                    \bound i \Gamma, (y : A), (f : \arr x A y)&otherwise
                                                  \end{cases*}\\
  &\inc i \epsilon {(x : \star)} &&= \langle x \rangle\\
  &\inc i \epsilon {\Gamma, (y : A) , (f : \arr x A y)} &&=
                                                           \begin{cases*}
                                                             \inc i \epsilon \Gamma&if \(i < \dim(A)\)\\
                                                             \inc i - \Gamma&if \(i = \dim(A)\) and \(\epsilon = -\)\\
                                                             \replace(\inc i + \Gamma, y)&if \(i = \dim(A)\) and \(\epsilon = +\)\\
                                                             \langle \inc i \epsilon \Gamma, y, f \rangle &otherwise
                                                           \end{cases*}
\end{alignat*}
where \(\epsilon \in \{-,+\}\) and \(\replace(\langle \sigma, s \rangle, t) = \langle \sigma, t \rangle\). As it will be common to take the boundary of \(\Gamma\) at the dimension below the dimension of \(\Gamma\) itself, we write
\[\inc {} \epsilon \Gamma = \inc {\dim(\Gamma) - 1} \epsilon \Gamma\]
when \(\dim(\Gamma)\) is not zero.

In the original \Catt paper, these inclusion substitutions are not given and instead the source and target variables are given directly as subcontexts. It can be easily checked that the free variables of the inclusions are equal to the subcontexts, and that the free variable sets of these inclusions are downwards closed. It is known, e.g. from \cite[Lemma~55]{benjamin2021globular}, that these constructions agree with the constructions of the source and target pasting diagrams in \cref{sec:pasting-diagrams}.

\subsection{Typing for \Catt}
\label{sec:typing-catt}

We now have all the prerequisites in place to state the typing rules for \Catt. These take the form of 4 judgements (not including the judgements for Ps-contexts introduced in \cref{sec:ps-contexts}):
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  &\Gamma \vdash&\quad&\text{\(\Gamma \in \Ctx\) is a well-formed context.}\\
  &\Gamma \vdash A&&\text{\(A \in \Type_\Gamma\) is a well-formed type in context \(\Gamma\).}\\
  &\Gamma \vdash t : A &&\text{\(t \in \Term_\Gamma\) is a well-formed term of type \(A \in \Type_\Gamma\).}\\
  &\Gamma \vdash \sigma : \Delta &&\text{\(\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma\) is a well-formed substitution.}
\end{alignat*}

The typing rules for these judgements are then given in \cref{fig:catt-typing}. As most of these are standard we draw attention to a couple of the key rules. The rule for arrow types ensures that both the source and target of the arrow themselves have the same type, namely the one given in the subscript of the arrow. This effectively ensures the globular nature of the type theory, as given a term \(f : \arr s {\arr x A y} t\), both the source of the source and source of the target are \(x\), and both the target of the source and target of the target are \(y\).

    \and

  \end{mathpar}
  \caption{Typing rules for \Catt}
  \label{fig:catt-typing}
\end{figure}

There are two rules given for typing coherence, corresponding to the two guiding principles for categories from \cref{sec:weak}. The first rule allows composites to be typed and the second allows equivalences to be typed. In both, the Ps-context \(\Delta\) corresponds to the pasting diagram \(P\), the terms \(s\) and \(t\) correspond to the operations \(f\) and \(g\) over \(P\) (with the judgement \(\Delta \vdash \arr s A t\) enforcing that they are parallel), and the conditions involving support give the remaining side conditions.

By a straightforward mutual induction we can prove that application of substitution to terms, types, and other substitutions preserves typing. Therefore, the \emph{syntactic category} of \Catt can be formed, which contains well-formed contexts as objects and well-typed substitutions between these contexts as morphisms, which by abuse of notation we also call \Catt. There is a full subcategory \(\Catt^{\mathsf{ps}}\), which only contains the contexts which are Ps-contexts.

\begin{theorem}
  The category \(\Catt^{\mathsf{ps}}\) is a coherator for \(\infty\)-categories.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Follows from \cite[Theorem~73]{benjamin2021globular}, noting that the opposite convention for substitution is used in that paper.
\end{proof}

Thus, we immediately get that a presheaf over \(\Catt^{\mathsf{ps}}\) which preserves globular products is an \(\infty\)-category (using the Maltsiniotis definition). Further, presheafs of this form are equivalent to type-theoretic models of \Catt by \cite[Theorem~88]{benjamin2021globular}, meaning type-theoretic models of \Catt are \(\infty\)-categories.

\subsection{Basic constructions}
\label{sec:basic-constructions}

We now introduce some examples of basic categorical operations in order to give some early examples. Suppose we have terms \(a : \arr s \star t\) and \(b : \arr t \star u\) in some context \(\Gamma\). Then the Ps-context
\[ \Delta = (x : \star), (y : \star), (f : \arr x \star y), (z : \star), (g : \arr y \star z) \]
from \cref{judg:ps} can be used to form the 1-composite:
\[ a *_0 b = \Coh \Delta {\arr x \star z} {\langle s, t, a, u, b \rangle}\]
It is often not necessary to give all the terms in a substitution, especially when the substitution is from a pasting diagram (or more generally a globular set). In these cases it is sufficient to give terms for the \emph{locally maximal} variables of the context, those that do not appear as the source or target of another variable. For \(\Delta\), the locally maximal variables are \(f\) and \(g\), and so it suffices to give the substitution above as \(\langle a , b \rangle\), with the rest of the terms being inferable.

The disc contexts \(D^n\) can be formed in \Catt as the analogue of the disc globular sets given in \cref{ex:disc} and satisfy the property that a substitution from a disc context \(D^n\) contains the same data as a term and \(n\)-dimensional type. Given a term \(t\) of type \(A\) in context \(\Gamma\), we write this substitution \(\{A,t\} : D^{\dim(A)} \to \Gamma\). All disc contexts are Ps-contexts.

Using these, the identity can be formed on a term \(t\) of type \(A\) in \(\Gamma\):
\[\id(A,t) = \Coh {D^n} {\arr {d_n} {} {d_n}} {\{A, t\}}\]
where \(\dim(A) = n\), which is typed using the rule for equivalences. The structure of this term changes for different values of \(n\), and we will relate these different terms in \cref{sec:suspension}. As before, the non-locally maximal elements of a substitution
can be inferred, and so we may write \(\id(t)\) or \(\{t\}\) when the type \(A\) is inferable\footnote{In \Catt, all types are inferable, though later it may be necessary to specify the exact type we are using up to syntactic equality.}.

\paragraph{Standard coherences}
The composite and identity above form part of a more general collection of coherences, which we call \emph{standard coherences}.

\begin{definition}
  Given a pasting diagram \(\Delta\), we mutually define for all \(n\) the \emph{standard coherence} \(\mathcal{C}_\Delta^n\), the \emph{standard term} \(\mathcal{T}_\Delta^n\), and the \emph{standard type} \(\mathcal{U}_\Delta^n\):
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
    &\mathcal{C}_\Delta^n &&= \Coh \Delta {\mathcal{U}_\Delta^n} {\id_\Delta}\\
    &\mathcal{T}_\Delta^n &&=
                           \begin{cases}
                             d^n &\text{when \(\Delta\) is the disc \(D^n\)}\\
                             \mathcal{C}_\Delta^n &\text{otherwise}
                           \end{cases}\\
    &\mathcal{U}_\Delta^0 &&= \star\\
    &\mathcal{U}_\Delta^{n+1} &&= \arr {\mathcal{T}_{\bound n \Delta}^n \sub {\inc n - \Delta}} {\mathcal{U}_\Delta^n} {\mathcal{T}_{\bound n \Delta}^n \sub {\inc n + \Delta}}
  \end{alignat*}
  The standard type takes the standard term over each boundary of \(\Delta\), includes these all back into \(\Delta\) and assembles them into a type. When \(n = \dim(\Delta)\) we will refer to the standard coherence as the \emph{standard composite}.
\end{definition}

It is immediate that the composite \(a *_0 b\) is given by \(\mathcal{C}_\Delta^1\sub{\langle a , b \rangle}\) and the identity on a term \(t\) of dimension \(n\) is given by \(\mathcal{C}_{D^n}^{n+1}\sub{\{t\}}\). This construction can be used to generate all the composites in the definition of a strict \(\infty\)-category. For example the vertical composite of \(2\)-cells is the standard composite over the context given by the diagram:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x && y
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f"', curve={height=24pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "h", curve={height=-24pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g"{description}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=0, to=2]
    \arrow["\beta", shorten <=3pt, shorten >=3pt, Rightarrow, from=2, to=1]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
and the horizontal composite of \(2\)-cells is the standard composite over:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    x & y & z
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "i", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=3, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "h"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\alpha", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=1, to=0]
    \arrow["\beta", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=3, to=2]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
Noting that the standard type over the above diagram has source \(f * h\) and target \(g * i\), themselves being standard compositions demonstrating the mutual recursive behaviour of these constructions.

\begin{remark}
  Above we gave two Ps-contexts by drawing a diagram of the globular set that they represent. Ps-contexts fix the order that variables occur in and as such the mapping from Ps-contexts to globular sets is injective. The use of diagrams to define Ps-contexts is therefore unambiguous.
\end{remark}

\paragraph{Further examples}
The substitution component of a coherence allows operations to be combined into compound operations. Consider the (Ps-)context given by the following diagram:
\[\Gamma =
  \begin{tikzcd}
    s & t & u & v
    \arrow["a", from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["b", from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow["c", from=1-3, to=1-4]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
There are (at least) 3 ways to compose together the elements of this context. We could take the unbiased ternary composite \(a * b * c = \mathcal{C}_\Gamma^1\sub{\langle a, b, c\rangle}\), but could also construct either biased composite:
\begin{align*}
  (a * b) * c &= \mathcal{C}_\Delta^1\sub{\langle \mathcal{C}_\Delta^1\sub{\langle a,b\rangle}, c\rangle}\\
  a * (b * c) &= \mathcal{C}_\Delta^1\sub{\langle a, \mathcal{C}_\Delta^1\sub{\langle b, c\rangle}\rangle}\\
\end{align*}
Using the equivalence typing rule, we can relate these biased composite with the following term:
\[ \alpha_{a,b,c} = \Coh \Gamma {\arr {(a * b) * c} {} {a * (b * c)}} {\id_\Gamma}\]
which is the associator. Similarly for a term \(f : \arr x \star y\), unitors can be form over the disc context \(D^1\) using the equivalence rule:
\begin{align*}
  \lambda_f &= \Coh {D^1} {\arr {\id(d_0^-) * d_1} {} {d_1}} {\{f\}}\\
  \rho_f &= \Coh {D^1}  {\arr {d_1 * \id(d_0^-)} {} {d_1}} {\{f\}}
\end{align*}
The remainder of the operations for a 2-category can be defined similarly, as each displays the equivalence of two terms built over a pasting diagram. We observe that both the unitors and associator (as well as any coherence typed with the equivalence rule) are trivially invertible.
